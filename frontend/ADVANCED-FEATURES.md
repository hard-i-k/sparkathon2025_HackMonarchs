I already have a working home page in my React app.

Now I want to extend it with the following features in **React frontend**, **Node.js + Express backend**, and **MongoDB**:

---

### 🔘 1. Update Existing Home Page

- ✅ Keep the current design as-is
- ✅ Add two new buttons at the top or a visible section:
  - **"Add Grocery Product"** → Navigate to route `/add-grocery`
  - **"Add Other Product"** → Navigate to route `/add-other`

---

### 🟢 2. Add Grocery Product Page (`/add-grocery`)

- A form with:
  - `brandName` (text)
  - `productCategory` (dropdown): Paneer, Yogurt, Cheese, Butter, Cake, Bread, Pastries, Rolls, Shrimp, Salmon, Fish, Crab
  - `dateAdded` (auto-filled current date)
  - `city` (text)
  - `dateOfManufacturing` (date)
  - `mrp` (number)
  - `image` (upload or URL input)
  - `stock` (number)
- On Submit → POST to `/api/products/grocery`
- Save product to DB and show in:
  - 📦 Global product listing
  - 📊 **Grocery Dashboard** (separate from other products)

---

### 🟣 3. Add Other Product Page (`/add-other`)

- A form with:
  - `name` (text)
  - `category` (text or dropdown)
  - `listingDate` (defaults to today)
  - `dateOfManufacturing` (date)
  - `mrp` (number)
  - `city` (text)
  - `image` (upload or URL input)
  - `stock` (number)
- On Submit → POST to `/api/products/other`
- Save product to DB and show in:
  - 📦 Global product listing
  - 📊 **Other Products Dashboard** (separate from grocery)

---

### 📊 4. Seller Dashboards (Separate Views)

#### A. Grocery Dashboard (`/dashboard/grocery`)
- Show seller’s email or ID at the top
- Table with:
  - Product Name
  - Category
  - MRP
  - Date Added
  - Stock
  - **Best Price** predicted by ML model
  - **Edit Price** button to manually change selling price

#### B. Other Products Dashboard (`/dashboard/other`)
- Show seller’s email or ID at the top
- Table with:
  - Product Name
  - Category
  - Listing Date
  - Production Date
  - Stock
  - MRP
  - **Best Price** predicted by ML
  - Allow changing listing date (future date) → show predicted price for that future date (call ML model)
  - **Edit Price** button to override

---

### 🎯 Backend API (Node.js + Express)

**Grocery POST** `/api/products/grocery`
```json
{
  "brandName": "Amul",
  "category": "Paneer",
  "dateAdded": "2025-07-13",
  "city": "Mumbai",
  "dateOfManufacturing": "2025-07-10",
  "mrp": 200,
  "image": "image_url",
  "stock": 30
}
# 🚀 Advanced Voice Assistant with Conversation Memory

## New Features Added:

### 1. **Conversation Memory System** 🧠
- Remembers previous queries in each session
- Context-aware responses to "that phone", "earlier", "compare" etc.
- Session-based conversation tracking

### 2. **Advanced Context Detection** 🔍
- Detects when user refers to previous items
- Identifies comparison requests
- Smart product recommendations based on context

### 3. **Enhanced AI Integration** ✨
- Google Gemini API for intelligent responses
- Context-aware prompts with conversation history
- Fallback to enhanced basic processing

## Demo Commands to Try:

### Basic Conversation Flow:
1. **"Show me eco-friendly phones under 50000"**
   - System shows sustainable phones
   - Stores conversation for context

2. **"Tell me more about that phone"** 
   - References previous phone query
   - Uses conversation memory

3. **"Compare it with laptops"**
   - Context-aware comparison
   - Builds on previous conversation

### Advanced Queries:
- **"What was the phone I asked about earlier?"**
- **"Show me more options like that"**
- **"Compare the first one with something cheaper"**

## Technical Implementation:

### Memory Storage:
```javascript
conversationMemory.set(sessionId, conversations)
productRecommendations.set(sessionId, products)
```

### Context Detection:
```javascript
getConversationContext(sessionId, text) {
  // Detects: "that", "it", "earlier", "compare"
  // Returns: { isPreviousRef, isComparison, recentProducts }
}
```

### Advanced AI Processing:
```javascript
processWithAdvancedAI(text, sessionId, context, res) {
  // Context-aware Gemini API prompts
  // Conversation history integration
  // Smart product recommendations
}
```

## Testing:

1. Start server: `node server/index.js`
2. Open voice assistant page
3. Try the demo commands above
4. Notice how it remembers context!

## Benefits:

✅ **Natural Conversations**: "Show me that phone again"  
✅ **Context Awareness**: Remembers what you talked about  
✅ **Smart Comparisons**: "Compare it with laptops"  
✅ **Session Memory**: Tracks your entire shopping journey  
✅ **AI Powered**: Intelligent responses with Google Gemini  

Your voice assistant is now truly conversational! 🎉
