## üéØ Objective

To solve the challenge of:
- Overstocked perishable goods leading to expiry-related losses

## üí° Solution Summary

Our platform provides two major modules:

### ü•¨ 1. Grocery Dashboard
Focused on perishable goods like dairy, bakery, produce

- Predicts the optimal selling price based on:
  - Expiry date proximity
  - Demand in a specific city
  - Stock quantity and MRP
  - Seasonal/festival-based trends

- ML model suggests dynamic pricing to clear inventory before expiry, while preserving maximum possible margin.

### üíª 2. Electronics Dashboard
Focused on tech products like smartphones, tablets, and laptops

- Suggests current best price based on:
  - Product age and release cycle
